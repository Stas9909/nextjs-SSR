      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>our technique — smashing a fresh, never frozen, 100% Certified Angus Beef® hand-packed ball of meat on a hot seasoned grill — results in a delicious burger standing alone in taste, texture, and juiciness. Add butter-toasted artisan buns, real cheeses, freshly chopped produce, and robust sauces, and you've got a burger with no comparison!</p>
